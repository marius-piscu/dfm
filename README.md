Distributed File Manager (DFM)
==============================

Story
-----

	I'am a ubuntu user and observed that there is no client implemented for google drive. I have some plans on learning python so implementing a clinet would be a good oportunity to do this. The advantage would be that python is cross platform, so I decided to start this project. While thinking about this I decided to implement it in a generic way as the basic mechanisms are the same only remote API is different. I will see where it goes and how much time I can invest in this initiative. 

Description
-----------

  This application is a distributed file manager which allows management of different cloud storage accounts from a single
desktop application.
  For each account basic operations like create, delete, view and synchronization are implemented.

Currently supported storages are:
- local
- google
- dropbox
  
The application is cross platform and can be used on windows, linux or mac.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

 TBD
